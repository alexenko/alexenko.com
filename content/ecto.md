Finally I gave up and purchased [Ecto][] today. Don't get me wrong, I
don't <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hate</span> the
wordpress admin interface, but it's definitely not a streamlined process
to make blog posts from wp-admin. At least not as streamlined as I would
like it to be. I was thinking about getting [Blogo][], but for some
reason Blogo's interface just didn't click with me, I had the hardest
time getting it to do what I want. Bonus: Ecto is \$5 cheaper. I didn't
actually take the price into account since \$5 doesn't make much of a
difference, especially considering the lifetime of this particular piece
of software. Pretty happy with my choice at the moment.
