**Problem:** The electron energy-loss spectra (EELS) is dominated by a
sharp plasmon peak at 3.83 eV[1. H. Herenreich and H. R. Phillipp, Phys.
Rev. 128, 1622 (1962)], whose position and width are badly reproduced in
DFT-LDA random phase approximation (RPA)[2. M. A. Cazalilla, J. S.
Dolado, A. Rubio, and P. M. Echenique, Phys. Rev. B. 61, 8033 (2000)]. A
similar discrepancy occurs in the reflectance spectrum, where the very
narrow dip at 3.92 eV is hardly reproduced by DFT-LDA calculations.

Although the coexistence of quasiparticles and collective excitations in
an interacting system is well known, our knowledge of their properties
and mutual interactions in real materials is far from being complete.
One of the most successful approaches to the calculation of the
quasiparticle band structure for a wide range of materials is the GW
method[3. L. Hedin, Phys. Rev. 139, A796 (1965)]. Recently full
quasiparticle calculations have been carried out only for Cu obtaining
an excellent agreement with the experimental band structure[4. A.
Marini, G. Onida, and R. Del Sole, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 016403 (2002)].
Here the authors show that the position and width of the plasmon
resonance in silver are correctly predicted by ab initio calculations
including self-energy effects within the GW approximation. Unlike in
simple metals, and semiconductors, quasiparticle corrections play a key
role and are essential to obtain electron energy loss in quantitative
agreement with the experimental data. The sharp reflectance minimum at
3.92 eV, is well described within GW.
