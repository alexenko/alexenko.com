Linear and nonlinear methods of optical spectroscopy are rapidly gaining
importance for materials characterization. Even-order nonlinear optical
spectroscopy has emerged as an unusually sensitive technique for
noninvasive analysis of surfaces and buried interfaces of
centrosymmetric materials. Though experimentalists are making great
strides towards accumulating knowledge on second harmonic generation, it
is hard to devise an experiment where all of the independent variables
are accounted for.[1. [R. Leitsmann, et. al, Phys. Rev. B 71, 195209,
2005][]] This is where predictions from theory come in.

More information can be found on [wikipedia][]. Why is this phenomenon
important? Linear optical response is not sensitive enough for real time
observation of conformational changes. In addition it is hard to tell
the difference between similar molecules adsorbed on a surface using
linear optical response. Nonlinear optical response on the other hand is
MUCH more sensitive. Minute changes to orientation or conformation of
molecules on a surface result in an appreciable (and measurable)
difference in in the spectrum. This precise nature of the response has,
unfortunately, been the very reason why the predictions from first
principles is lagging behind. Over the next few posts I will talk about
what I am currently doing as part of my dissertation at Norfolk State
University and how SHG is calculated from first principles.
