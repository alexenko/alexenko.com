So after months of owning alexenko.com I have finally decided to
actually do something with it. The general idea is to have a place where
I can organize my ideas and opinions but also where I can post my
resume.

My background is in Information Technology and I received my Bachelor's
in IT (with concentration in Network Security) from New Jersey Institute
of Technology in 2005. I then promptly decided that I am not interested
in actually working in the IT department, and I changed my major to
Materials Science. Currently I am in the Materials Science and
Engineering PhD program at Norfolk State University in Virginia. My
research interests lie in computational modeling and engineering of
novel materials exhibiting strong non-linear properties. I will post on
this in detail in the future.
