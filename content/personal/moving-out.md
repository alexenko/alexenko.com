I hate moving.

That said, I don't actually hate moving. Moving just tends to be a very stressful time and I have some personal baggage, so that doesn't make it any easier. Everything that has been in it's place for the past three years, now has to be evaluated if it's worth having to move to a new place. The place I'm moving to is also much smaller than the one I'm currently in (~900sqft vs >1300sqft). So I have to purge. 

Some things are easily parted with, some not so much. I promise I will use my WiiFit board! No, I probably won't, but what if I decide that I want to, and I don't have it? How about the wooden trebuchet model? I mean look at it, it's awesome! It uses pennies to projectile balls across the room! But I won't have any room, and I will be working from home, so there's no one to use for target practice. This is the dialog in my head for the past two weeks. It sucks.

However, it's actually quite awesome. I am closing one chapter in my life and moving on. ITT Tech has been a good springboard and I am very excited to get to work on Coursly full time. No more paperwork! Or at least no more pointless paperwork! Awesome sauce.

I hate moving.
