Usually when you play a decent RPG you can follow the quest chains, upgrade your gear, and just chug along on the rails laid by the game maker. This tends to be the option that's recommended, and it's really the only option if you want to experience whatever it is the developer wants you to experience. 

Or you can just say fuck it, and do whatever the hell you want to. Run around and collect flowers (I __LOVE__ herbalism in WoW, hurm), teabag newbies, try to run your horse/cat/bear up a mountain you're not supposed to run up. Try to solo dungeons you're not supposed to solo. You get the idea. Usually I have much more fun with the later option. I remember spending countless hours in World of Warcraft just running around, doing random things, not really leveling at all. 

Ever since I can remember, I usually stayed on the true and narrow. I didn't do drugs, didn't really drink, got a BS in Information Technology and a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering. And now it's time to veer off the rails.

Yesterday I submitted my two week notice to the Dean at ITT Tech. I'm done. No more re-enter calls (if there's ever a soul killing job, calling students that don't wish to attend the school anymore to try to change their mind, is it). No more getting yelled over incorrectly filled out TPS reports. And even though I will miss academia, for fucks sake I have been in academia since 1999, it's time to move on.
