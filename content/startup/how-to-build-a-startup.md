Udacity just started a course ([EP245: How to Build a Startup - The Lean
Launchpad][]) and so far I am very impressed. I have been reading up on
startups since the beginning of the year and this course is not only
well-timed, but also completely free\* (Though it doesn't cost anything
to take the course and Steve clearly points out that all of the optional
readings are just that, optional, I don't think one can digest and
understand that amount of information without the readings).[The Startup
Owner's Manual][] and [Business Model Generation][] are the two books
needed for this course (note: affiliate links) Luckily I bought the
Startup Owner's Manual a while back, just never got to read through it.
The majority of the first lecture is spent reviewing/discussing the
optional reading. I guess that is to be expected since the readings are
optional and not everyone would have access to the books. The gem of the
class, however, becomes apparent towards the end of theÂ  first lecture:
Steve shows how the BMG Canvas of JerseySquare evolved over the course
of 5 days and \~170 potential customer interviews.

This also gave me an excuse to finally wipe the whiteboard down and use
it for something. At this point I am not yet ready to discuss my
business idea here, but I will say that following Steve's advice and
writing all of the ideas out in such a fashion does bring an incredible
amount of clarity and structure. Next step is to find some potential
customers (or at least who I think would be my potential customers) and
verify that my perceived problem is an actual problem.
